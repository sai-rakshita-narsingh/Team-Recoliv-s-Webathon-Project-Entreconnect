              <h4>The investment group that I’ve invested with 10 times now has used Entreconnect.</h4>
            <p>“  It serves our needs very well. We are a group of 40-some diverse people, so not all of us like it; but we’ve investigated several times and not found anything even close, for our use.And I, as an individual, like it a lot. Good as it is, and always improving.
                Looking back, it was one of the best decisions we ever made.”</p>

              <p>“ I have been CMO of Entreconnect for over 3.5 years, and have loved every day of this job. It's important to mention that I have worked for notably fabulous companies before Entreconnect, and still, this has been a pretty unique experience.
                First of all, the team is great. High-perfoming and highly collaborative. The environment is friendly, warm, not defensive, honest and humble. We all help each other. We work hard and have fun every day.The intention is to provide the underlying technical and connective infrastructure for the global early stage finance industry, supporting every entrepreneurial startup, every angel investor, every venture fund and every related third party in the world on a single platform”</p>

We were able to raise our seed fund remotely through Zoom thanks to the great signalling and it was really cool to be mentored by folks like the founder of Docker, Algolia, and Twitch. It was also a good decision because a lot of great developer tools have come out of Entreconnect. and we really love how helpful/supportive the Entreconnect community is. ”</p>
