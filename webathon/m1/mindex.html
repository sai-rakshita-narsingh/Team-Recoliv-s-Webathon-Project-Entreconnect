        <p>
            I completed a full spectrum accounting education from my bachelor's, master's, CPA to working at a big accounting firm. This was all in a half-hearted attempt to rebel against my parent's wanting me to be a doctor/lawyer. In the end, I lost years of doing the work I actually love: using factual data to make important decisions for all things and making that accessible through open source, not just accounting. I wish I had mentors that empowered me to run towards problems that excite me rather than run away from one career to another. I hope to be that mentor I wish I had.
