            As a senior user researcher with over 15 years of experience running international research projects for global companies such as PlayStation, Spotify, and in the finance industry, I have developed a keen eye for what makes a successful UX researcher.
            Through my experience as a mentor, I have helped many researchers develop their generative and evaluative research skills and land their first job in the UX industry.

            There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says 'Morning, boys. How's the water?'
